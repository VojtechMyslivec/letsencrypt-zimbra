# letsencrypt-zimbra

Files to automate the deploy of letsencrypt certificates to Zimbra.

You will probably find these files usefull when you want to move your
self-signed Zimbra certificate to the letsencrypt-signed one and automate the
renewal of the certificate.

Start with *Setup manual* below and help message of the script
    ```
    obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh -h`
    ```

Enjoy **open-source** and **encryption**!


## Requirements

- Working installation of *Zimbra Collaboration Suite*
- *certbot* utility
- *openssl* cli tool
- *sudo* privilege to run *certbot* with `zimbra` user


## What the scripts do

The script will perform following steps:

1. Check installed Zimbra TLS certificate
    - The script exits if the cert is present and will not expire soon
    - See `-d` and `-f` options
2. Generate new Zimbra private key if it is missing
3. Generate signing request with given domain names
4. Stop Zimbra web server
5. Run `certbot` (in standalone mode) and use generated request
6. Start Zimbra web server
7. Check issued certificate and install it for Zimbra
8. Restart zimbra services

See the *help* message of the script (`-h`), example config file
(`letsencrypt-zimbra.cfg.example`) and the code itself for more details.


## Setup manual

1. Install the certbot

    - Please follow the [official instructions](https://certbot.eff.org/)
      for your distribution

    - For example on *Ubuntu xenial*:

        1. Add `certbot` *ppa* repository:

            ```
            apt-get install software-properties-common
            add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
            apt-get update
            ```

        2. Install `certbot` package

            ```
            apt-get install certbot
            ```

    - Alternatively, you can clone the `certbot` from Github:

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot.git /opt/certbot
        ```

2. Clone this repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/VojtechMyslivec/letsencrypt-zimbra.git /opt/letsencrypt-zimbra
    ```

3. Create and edit config file

    - Copy the example file

        ```
        cp /opt/letsencrypt-zimbra/letsencrypt-zimbra.cfg{.example,}
        ```

    - Configure your e-mail and server common names in
      `/opt/letsencrypt-zimbra/letsencrypt-zimbra.cfg`


4. Add sudo privileges to 'zimbra' user to run certbot

    - Copy prepared sudoers config:

        ```
        cp configs/sudoers.conf /etc/sudoers.d/zimbra_certbot
        ```

    - Test the sudo privilege for 'zimbra' user (no password should be needed)

        ```
        sudo -Hu zimbra sudo /usr/bin/certbot -h
        ```

5. Run the script to obtain certificate

    ```
    sudo -Hu zimbra /opt/letsencrypt-zimbra/obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh -v
    ```

    - *Note*: add the `-t ` option to run a test (see below)


6. Configure the cron job

    ```
    cp configs/cron.conf /etc/cron.d/letsencrypt-zimbra
    ```

    - Review the `/etc/cron.d/letsencrypt-zimbra` if it meets your system
      requirements


## Test the configuration and staging environment

Let's Encrypt authority provides [rate
limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).  The best practice is to
test the configuration and script on [staging
environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/), where rate
limits are much more benevolent. Certificates issued by this staging
environment are signed with *Fake LE ROOT* CA and so **they are not trusted**.

To use this environment, use `-t` option when running
`obtain-and-deploy-letsencrypt-cert.sh`. Also a verbose option `-v` is
recommended to see information messages what the script is doing.

When the script successfully deployed a staging cert, run the script again
with `-f` to force renew the cert with Let's Encrypt trusted CA.
